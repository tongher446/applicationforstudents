This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# üöÄ Git & GitHub Cheat Sheet for Beginners

This guide helps you save, backup, and restore your code using Git and GitHub.  
Never lose your work again! üí™

---

## üå± 1. INITIALIZE GIT REPOSITORY

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository in current folder
# Creates hidden .git folder to track all changes
git init

 ## 2. CHECK STATUS & HISTORY

# Show current status: branch, changed files, staged files
# Always run this first to understand your current state
git status

# Show commit history in compact format
# Each line = one saved version (commit)
git log --oneline

# Show ALL files currently tracked by Git
git ls-files

# Show remote repositories (like GitHub) connected to this project
git remote -v

# Stage ALL changed files for next commit
# "." means "everything in current directory and subdirectories"
git add .

# Stage specific file only (safer for big projects)
git add src/components/Navbar.jsx

# Save staged changes as a new version (commit)
# Always write clear, descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat: add animated navbar component"

# Save with multi-line message (press Enter, then Ctrl+D to finish)
git commit


# Connect local repo to GitHub repo (do this once)
# Replace URL with your actual GitHub repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename current branch to 'main' (standard name)
git branch -M main

# Push local commits to GitHub for the first time
# "-u" sets upstream so future pushes are easier
git push -u origin main

# Push subsequent changes (after first time)
git push


# Connect local repo to GitHub repo (do this once)
# Replace URL with your actual GitHub repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename current branch to 'main' (standard name)
git branch -M main

# Push local commits to GitHub for the first time
# "-u" sets upstream so future pushes are easier
git push -u origin main

# Push subsequent changes (after first time)
git push 

# Create and switch to new branch (for new features/fixes)
# Work here without breaking your main code
git checkout -b feature/redesign-login-page

# List all branches (current branch marked with *)
git branch

# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch into main (after testing)
git merge feature/redesign-login-page

# Delete feature branch (after merging)
git branch -d feature/redesign-login-page

# Push branch to GitHub (so others can see it)
git push origin feature/redesign-login-page


# TEMPORARILY view old version (safe, no data loss)
# Replace COMMIT_HASH with actual hash from git log
git checkout COMMIT_HASH

# Return to latest version after checking old one
git checkout main

# PERMANENTLY delete commits after specific version
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This erases history ‚Äî use carefully!
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH

# Push forced rollback to GitHub (after reset --hard)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Overwrites remote history
git push --force origin main

# SAFELY undo last commit (creates new "undo" commit)
# Best for shared projects ‚Äî keeps history intact
git revert COMMIT_HASH

# Push revert normally (no --force needed)
git push origin main


# 1. Start day ‚Äî get latest code from team/GitHub
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create new branch for your task
git checkout -b feature/add-footer-animation

# 3. ...work on code, make changes...

# 4. Save your work frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add floating animation to footer"

# 5. Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-footer-animation

# 6. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Create Pull Request ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge to main

# 7. Next day ‚Äî cleanup and update
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-footer-animation


# If Git not found in VS Code ‚Äî reload as Administrator
# Or manually reload PATH in terminal:
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")

# If you forgot to commit and made changes:
# Stash changes temporarily, then restore later
git stash
git stash pop

# See difference between current files and last commit
git diff

# See difference between two commits
git diff COMMIT_HASH_1 COMMIT_HASH_2

## ‚úÖ How to Use This File

1. Copy the entire content above
2. In your project folder, create a new file called `README.md`
3. Paste the content
4. Save it

Now you have a **permanent, searchable reference** for all essential Git commands ‚Äî with explanations!

## üí° Bonus: Render Beautiful README on GitHub

When you push this to GitHub, it will render beautifully with headings, code blocks, and emojis ‚Äî making it easy to read and share with teammates.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Save this `README.md` in your project
2. Run: `git add README.md`
3. Run: `git commit -m "docs: add Git & GitHub cheat sheet"`
4. Run: `git push origin main`

‚úÖ Now your cheat sheet is safely backed up on GitHub too!
